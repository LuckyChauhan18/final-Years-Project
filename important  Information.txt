y contains the category of the 178-dimensional input vector. Specifically y in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

5 - eyes open, means when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open

4 - eyes closed, means when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed

3 - Yes they identify where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recording the EEG activity from the healthy brain area

2 - They recorder the EEG from the area where the tumor was located

1 - Recording of seizure activity

âœ… Easy Explanation of this Signal Plot (figure number -3)

This graph shows the EEG (brainwave) measurements for one recording.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:

Each point on the line is a measurement of brain activity at a specific moment in time.

The x-axis (Time) represents the sequence in which the measurements were taken.

The y-axis (EEG Measurement) shows how strong or weak the brain signals were at that time.

The shape of the line shows how the brain's electrical activity changes over time â€” it goes up, down, and fluctuates.

ðŸ“– Simple analogy:

Imagine you're recording the sound of your heartbeat over time. Some beats are strong, some are weak, and some are irregular. The graph shows how it changes moment by moment.

Similarly, this EEG signal shows how the brainâ€™s activity rises and falls while recording data from sensors.

These patterns help doctors and machine learning models figure out whether the brain is functioning normally or if thereâ€™s something like a seizure happening.





âœ… What you see in the plot: (figure 3)

Scatter plots between pairs of features

For example, X1 vs X2, X1 vs X3, etc.

Helps you see if two features are positively correlated, negatively correlated, or unrelated.

Clusters may appear that correspond to different classes (y).

Diagonal plots are histograms

These show the distribution of each feature.

Helps you see skewness, spread, or whether a feature is normally distributed.

Different colors represent different classes

You can visually identify how separable or overlapping the classes are.

Useful for spotting patterns that machine learning models can exploit.

âœ… Why Pair Plots Are Useful:

âœ” Understand relationships â€“ See how features interact with each other.
âœ” Find patterns â€“ Some features may clearly separate classes, others may not.
âœ” Spot outliers â€“ Strange or extreme data points are easier to spot.
âœ” Check assumptions â€“ For example, linear relationships between features.

Logistic Regression (25%)

Itâ€™s a simple linear model that assumes features contribute linearly to the outcome.

EEG data is complex and may not follow linear relationships.

Thatâ€™s why it performs poorly â€” it canâ€™t capture the patterns.

Random Forest (70%)

Combines multiple decision trees, allowing it to model complex, nonlinear patterns.

Handles noisy or interacting features well.

Thatâ€™s why it performs much better on this dataset.


âœ… Key Takeaways

âœ” EEG signals are complex, so nonlinear models like Random Forest work better.
âœ” Logistic regression is good for simpler or linearly separable problems but not for EEG signals.
âœ” Random Forest is more flexible and can capture hidden patterns in data.
